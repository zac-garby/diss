** Steps taken to sort lists of /n/ elements in reverse order:
      - 0 items: 7 steps (0.001s)
	  - 1 item:   116 steps (0.001s)
	  - 2 items: 3014 steps (0.01s)
	  - 3 items: 231145 steps (0.28s)
	  - 4 items: 31705310 steps (38.4s)
	  - This is exponential :(
* After adding some strict applications
      - 4 items down to 30s
* After redefining =fix=
      - 4 items down to 29s, 30244974 steps
