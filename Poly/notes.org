* Potential areas to explore / things to implement
** Simultaneous equations in files
** Pattern matching
** User-defined data types
** AST editing directly/interactive hole filling
** User-defined infix operators?
** Modules/environment levels
** Lazy evaluation
** Better searching
*** e.g. =:s a -> b :from prelude.txt= - could search for specific files
*** e.g. =:s zip= - could also search for function names
* Bug!
  #+begin_src
\xs -> let hd = head xs in hd
  #+end_src
  Fixed - needed to =sub s= to the env when generalising the type for a let expression.
